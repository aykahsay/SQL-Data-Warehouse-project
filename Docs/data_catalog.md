## ğŸ”„ Update Frequency

Data in the Gold Layer is refreshed nightly via scheduled ETL processes. Surrogate keys are generated using `ROW_NUMBER()` functions during view materialization or ETL loads.

## ğŸ§  Usage Notes

- Dimensions support **slowly changing dimension (SCD)** logic for tracking attribute changes over time.
- Fact tables support **star schema** analytics, enabling performance across tools like Power BI, Tableau, or direct SQL analytics.
