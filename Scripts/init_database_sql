/*
==================================
Create Database and Schemas
==================================

Script Purpose:
This script creates a new database named 'DataWarehouse' after checking if it already exists.
If the database exists, it is dropped and recreated. Additionally, the script sets up
three schemas within the database: 'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold'.

WARNING:
Running this script will drop the entire 'DataWarehouse' database if it exists.
All data in the database will be permanently deleted.
Proceed with caution and ensure you have proper backups before running this script.
*/

-- Disconnect users from the database if it exists (syntax might vary)
-- For PostgreSQL, you might need to run this from a different database (e.g., 'postgres')
-- or have specific connection settings that allow dropping an in-use database.
-- For MySQL, you might not need an explicit disconnect for dropping
