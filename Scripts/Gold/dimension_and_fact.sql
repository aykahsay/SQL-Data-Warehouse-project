/**************************************************************************************************
  GOLD LAYER – BUSINESS-READY VIEWS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This script creates the Gold Layer for analytical and reporting purposes. The Gold Layer includes:
  
  1. gold.dim_customers  – Customer dimension enriched with demographic and geographic data.
  2. gold.dim_products   – Product dimension with category and lifecycle information.
  3. gold.fact_sales     – Fact table with transactional sales data linked to customer and product dimensions.

  These views integrate and clean data from the Silver Layer to provide meaningful insights.
